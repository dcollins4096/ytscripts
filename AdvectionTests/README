The *.enzo files should run out of the box.
Use p36_t01_tube.py to analyze them.  
Collision.enzo is a converging flow.  Makes the p36_U03* plots
Square_Contact.enzo is a square wave advection.  Makes the p36_U02* plots

FIRST use an undoctored copy of the enzo to make sure everything works.
THEN  use your MC code to make sure you're getting something meaningful.  At least,
not clearly wrong.
